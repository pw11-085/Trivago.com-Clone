# Trivago 
We have cloned a e-commerce application called Trivago.com It simply meant allowing booking a Hotel. Over time it has evolved to provide multiple benefits on one platform.

In this Project, We have tried to implement some of the application's functionalities like search. Along with these, we have tried sorting functionalities and the User flow of booking a hotel and applying the best available offers.

This is a group project of 5 people:- 1)Mahima Jaiswal 2)Shaikh Abusaeed 3)Yogesh Sharma 4)Shaikh Arbaz 5)Akshay
